Add note in kinematics module noting that kinematics must be updated before using reference frame objects

--- 10-13-2018 ---
Add Eigen stl vector specialization for Vector4d and Quaternion objects

--- 10-13-2018 ---
Add explicit keyword to a number of the classes constructors

--- 10-14-2018 ---
Remove temp data structures in Model struct.
Deprecate forwardDynamicsLagrangian that uses pointers and could result in memory allocations

--- 10-14-2018 ---
Add functions to calc the jacobians and their time derivatives in single functions instead of requiring two separate calls
which will be faster if you want to compute them both.

--- 12-08-2018 ---
Add optional bool arg to dynamics functions to not compute kinematics quantities if they've already been computed

--- 12-10-2018 ---
Add FixedReferenceFrame class to improve the API of fixed reference frames and to remove the requirement that you call frame->update() each tic 
for frames whose transformFromParent never changes after construction.

--- 12-31-2018 ---
In previous fix regarding the reference frame transforms before kinematics have been updated, I didn't account for the case where the parent frame is a 
fixed frame. Added bugfix here to account for that

--- 01-17-2019 ---
Fix bug with FrameOriention where operation was incorrect when calling changeFrame

--- 03-07-2019 ---
Add rdl_ros_tools package and rdl_msgs for the beginning of a set of ROS tools

--- 03-17-2019 ---
Fix issues making rdl incompatible with melodic

--- 04-05-2019 ---
Removed a bunch of deprecated functions

--- 04-06-2019 ---
Reworked FrameOrientation inheritance so it inherits from Quaternion instead of having a Quaternion

--- 04-07-2019 ---
Added Model::mass variable where you can get the mass of the model

--- 05-11-2019 ---
Remove the use of raw pointers and replace them with typedef'd std::shared_ptr's
Remove ReferenceFrameHolder
Minor rework to ReferenceFrame internal functionality to improve efficiency

--- 05-11-2019 ---
Create types.hpp file that auto generates shared_ptr typedef's

--- 05-11-2019 ---
Remove framepoint and point3d API's for adding other points bc it's not a defined operation kinematically

--- 05-12-2019 ---
Add center of mass reference frame

--- 11-02-2019 ---
Add missing dependency on tinyxml

--- 11-02-2019 ---
Replace some map/vector accessors in Model with .at accessor to help find index bugs that would instead segfault

--- 12-06-2019 ---
Modify how the center of mass frame is updated. Now it's done by separate functions. Also add function for computing gravity wrench on the center of mass

--- 12-09-2019 ---
Add com frame update function that accepts a quaternion

--- 12-21-2019 ---
Add functions for computing the center of mass velocity by itself

--- 1-10-2020 ---
Added function to quaternion class to perform quaternion sanitize

--- 1-17-2020 ---
Add ability to decompose quaternions into swing-twist quaternions

--- 4-2-2020 ---
Add com velocity functions that don't require q or qdot

--- 4-6-2020 ---
Add utility functions for q indices w.r.t urdf parsing

--- 6-1-2020 ---
Fix transform/transform_copy mechanics so transform call doesn't doesnt make useless copies
Make some model member variables that should be force types use SpatialForce instead of spatial vector
Remove some unnecessary functionality regarding transformTranspose of inverse transforms
Now allow rotated inertial inertia in urdfreader
Add coriolisEffects function to dynamics functions

--- 9-24-2020 ---
Improve Api for rotation conversions to/from euler angles

--- 9-30-2020 ---
Fixed some API issues with point3d/vector3d/framepoint/framevector operator overloads

--- 1-25-2020 ---
Improve setters/constructors to geometry types to make it easier to interchange types

--- 1-26-2020 ---
Add a transform_copy to Point3d class

--- 4-17-2021 ---
Update model class to be no-copy

--- 4-17-2021 ---
Adding parallel kinematics option

--- 10-5-2021 ---
Removed ros tools and cmake packages
Updated to build with ament

--- 05-2023 ---
ros parameters for runtime modification of model parameters
primitive hydro dynamics


--- 10-25-2023 ---
fix bug where ros parameters loaded from a file were not handled porperly
